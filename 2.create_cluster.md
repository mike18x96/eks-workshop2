copy content

```
apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
kind: ClusterConfig

metadata:
  name: basic-cluster

into cluster.yaml

```

type ``:wq`` to write and quit vi(m)

```
eksctl create cluster -f cluster.yaml

you should see:

login into aws console and let's take a look at the Cloudformation service in us-west-2

when creation is done
review following resources VPC, IAM, EKS, EC2 Security groups


you can use aws eks to see the details too

```
eksctl get cluster
```

```
aws eks describe-cluster --name basic-cluster
```


If you want to reuse existing vpc you can add vpc section:

```
apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
kind: ClusterConfig

metadata:
  name: cluster-in-existing-vpc
  region: us-west-2

vpc:
  subnets:
    private:
      eu-north-1a: { id: subnet-iddsfsdfsddfsdfda }
      eu-north-1b: { id: subnet-iddsfsdfsddfsdfdb }
      eu-north-1c: { id: subnet-iddsfsdfsddfsdfdc }
```

while cluster upgrade is in progress, please review other options from the eksctl cluster section:
https://eksctl.io/usage/creating-and-managing-clusters/

and take a look at official github page: https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl


When you are done please delete the cluster

```
eksctl delete cluster -f cluster.yaml
```

double check if all resources(EKS, VPC,...) are gone
